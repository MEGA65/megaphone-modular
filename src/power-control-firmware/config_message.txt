---------------------------------
https://github.com/MEGA65/megaphone-modular/tree/main/src/power-control-firmware
Produced with the support of the NLnet Foundation (nlnet.nl)

Commands:
        ? - Show this message
	. - Report current status
	P - Playback cellular modem event log
	X - Clear cellular modem event log
      0-9 - Power circuit (drive enable pin high)
shift 0-9 - De-power circuit (pull enable pin low)
      A-Z - Select UART speed for cellular modem

Playback ends with NUL (0x00) character.

Status indication at 0.5Hz (or as requested via '.'):
     bit 7 : Always set to 1 (i.e., status bytes are 0x80 -- 0xff)
     bit 6 : Set if cellular modem events logged
  bits 5-0 : Status of first six power circuits
